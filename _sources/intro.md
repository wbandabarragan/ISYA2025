# The International School for Young Astronomers 2025: Ecuador
The International School for Young Astronomers (ISYA) is an initiative of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to reinforce and promote the development of professional astronomy in communities around the world. The ISYA places a special emphasis on students located in areas that do not have the benefit of a local research institute that teaches most of the sub-disciplines of Astronomy.

The IAU Executive Committee has selected Yachay Tech University, to host its 45th International School for Young Astronomers from the 6th to the 26th of July 2025. The School is co-organized by 4 universities in Ecuador, namely Yachay Tech University, Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Universidad Central del Ecuador, and Universidad del Azuay.

We expect to receive applications to attend this School from students in their early MSc/PhD studies and some senior undergraduates in the Americas, especially from Latin American and Caribbean countries. 30 students will be selected to participate in this school. All the selected students will participate in an intensive three-week program of lectures, practices and projects, with up-to-date astrophysics, both on theory and observations, led by an international team of experts. They will learn about different astronomical fields, from exoplanets to cosmology, and acquire technical expertise to analyze current astronomical data and models, mainly from access to large databases.

The official language of the School will be English. And, although the ISYA is not a research conference, we encourage students to submit abstracts to present their research projects.

Acceptance to the school covers flights to and from Quito (including domestic transport to Urcuquí), accommodation and subsistence at the ISYA. All selected students are expected to commit 100% of their time to participate in all the planned activities held over the three week duration of the school. Notice that, apart from the academic school activities, you will also have the opportunity to experience the archaeological, artistic and scientific environments through a series of cultural visits, events and travels.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Ecuador in 2025!
